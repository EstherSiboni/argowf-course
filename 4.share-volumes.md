## Sharing data volumes between tasks

It is very common that tasks produce data by generating or transforming files, so that other tasks can make use of the files to perform other tasks.

To do that, we will need to make use of a volume. A volume represents a disk volume mounted as a directory in a container.

To do that we need to do two things:

1. Declare a k8s volume

In the main attribute `spec` we can make use of the attribute `volumeClaimTemplates`, which generates a volume based on a given template.

In the following example, we want to generate a volume called `shared-volume`, with some particular characteristics:

- Access mode as `ReadWriteOnce`. It means that the volume can be accessed by only one single pod
- Request storage: `1Gi`, this is one gigabyte of data

2. Indicate the mount location

On each container, we need to specify the directory where the disk should be mounted, with the attribute `volumeMounts`. It representes an array of objects that indicate the name of the volume declared in step 1 and the directory where the volume should be mounted.

```yaml
volumeMounts:
- name: name-of-volume
  mountPath: /some-directory
```

Let's test the usage by creating a new WorkflowTemplate with two steps:

1. A step that clones a repository
2. A step that lists the contents of the repository

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: WorkflowTemplate
metadata:
  name: simple-pipeline
spec:

  # We tell k8s that we want to create a new volume
  # It will be created before the Workflow is created
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: shared-volume
      spec:
        accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
        resources: 
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi

  entrypoint: all-steps
  templates:
  
  - name: all-steps
    dag:
      tasks:
      - name: clone
        template: git-clone
      - name: check-repo
        template: listing
        dependencies: ["clone"]


  - name: git-clone
    container:
      # The volume should be mounted in the directory /my-crazy-location
      volumeMounts:
      - name: shared-volume
        mountPath: /my-crazy-location
      image: alpine/git
      command:
      - /bin/sh
      - -c
      - |
        cd /my-crazy-location
        git clone https://github.com/devopscompanynl/argowf-course
  
  - name: listing
    container:
      # The volume should be mounted in the directory /my-crazy-location
      volumeMounts:
      - name: shared-volume
        mountPath: /my-crazy-location
      image: alpine/git
      command:
      - /bin/sh
      - -c
      - |
        cd /my-crazy-location
        ls -la
        ls -la argowf-course
```

**Exercise:**

Create a new WorkflowTemplate that has three steps:

  - Clone the repository. Image: alpine/git
  - Create a virtual environment. Image: python:3
  - Run tests. Image: python:3

The scripts of each step are the following:

**Clone the repository**

```bash
cd /mount

echo "Cloning the repository"
git clone https://github.com/devopscompanynl/argowf-course
```

**Create a virtual environment**

Consider using `/bin/bash` instead of `/bin/sh`

```bash
cd /mount

# Command to create a new virtual environment
echo "Creating virtual environments"
python -m venv app-venv
```

**Run tests**

Consider using `/bin/bash` instead of `/bin/sh`

```bash
cd /mount

echo "Sourcing the virtual environment"
source app-venv/bin/activate

echo "Accessing to the source code"
cd argowf-course/sources/python-app

echo "Installing packages"
pip install -r requirements.txt

echo "Running unit-tests"
python -m unittest discover
```
