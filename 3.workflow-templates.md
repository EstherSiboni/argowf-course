## Working with WorkflowTemplates

At the moment, the dashboard has been only useful to see the running workflows. But there is something that does not make sense, it looks like I always need to write code to run a pipeline, that is not very handy.

We can make use of a resource called WorkflowTemplate. It is a static template that we can instantiate whenever is needed we need it via the dashboard.

Let's demonstrate how it works.

Apply the following WorkflowTemplate and then open the dashboard and click on the second option of the left sidebar to see the available WorkflowTemplates

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: WorkflowTemplate
metadata:
  name: whalesay-hello
spec:
  entrypoint: whalesay
  templates:
  - name: whalesay
    container:
      image: docker/whalesay
      command: [cowsay]
      args: ["This is a beautiful day!"]
```

Click on the WorkflowTemplate and you will see the details about it with buttons to perform multiple actions.

One of the actions we want to test is the `SUBMIT` action.

If you click on it, the dashboard will show you a modal that allows you to generate a new Workflow based on the WorkflowTemplate.

Click on `SUBMIT` on the modal and you will be redirected to the view of the new running Workflow.

Let's now create a WorkflowTemplate with multiple steps (a template invocator)

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: WorkflowTemplate
metadata:
  name: multiple-steps-dag
spec:
  entrypoint: all-steps
  templates:
  
  - name: all-steps
    dag:
      tasks:
      - name: the-very-first-step
        template: run-python
      - name: my-second-step
        template: whalesay
        dependencies: ["the-very-first-step"]


  - name: run-python
    script:
      image: python:3
      command: [python]
      source: |
        import random
        # Generate a random integer between 1 and 100
        i = random.randint(1, 100)
        print(i)
  
  - name: whalesay
    container:
      image: docker/whalesay
      command: [cowsay]
      args: ["hello world"]
```

### Use input parameters

Pipelines and tasks mostly use of parameters to produce a result based on input data.
In the following examples we will learn how to make use of parameters in the world of Workflows

To do that we need to specify the `inputs` attribute as part of the template object. This way, Workflows create variables that later we can inject in the value of any of the keys of the definitions.

The `input` attribute accepts an object called `parameters` which is an array of objects that describe the name of the variable and its default value.

```yaml
inputs:
  parameters:
  - name: my-variable
    value: "This is the default value"
```

We can access those keys via the templating system by using the notation `{{inputs.parameters.my-variable}}` where the variable.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: WorkflowTemplate
metadata:
  name: whalesay-hello
spec:
  entrypoint: whalesay
  templates:
  - name: whalesay
    # Adding the input attribute
    inputs:
      parameters:
        # Here, the name of the variable is called 'what-to-say'
        - name: what-to-say
          value: "Hello from the parameters"
    container:
      image: docker/whalesay
      command: [cowsay]
      # We can access to the value of the variable
      args: ["{{inputs.parameters.what-to-say}}"]
```

How can we fill in the arguments of those input parameters from the dashboard?

We can **provide the values** of those parameters by using the **arguments** attribute.

From a WorkflowTemplate, in the specification we use the `arguments` attribute as follows:

```yaml
arguments:
  parameters:
  - name: my-variable
```

This will fill in the input parameters of the entrypoint. Because, the one that is calling the templates/tasks is the one that should provide the values of the arguments

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: WorkflowTemplate
metadata:
  name: whalesay-hello
spec:
  entrypoint: whalesay
  arguments:
    parameters:
    # This will overwrite the parameter in the task!
    - name: what-to-say
  templates:
  - name: whalesay
    inputs:
      parameters:
        - name: what-to-say
          value: "Hello from the parameters"
    container:
      image: docker/whalesay
      command: [cowsay]
      args: ["{{inputs.parameters.what-to-say}}"]
```

### Use input parameters with Template Invocators

When the Workflow executes multiple tasks by using template invocators then, the `arguments` attribute does not provide the values to the input parameters of the tasks in the `dag` or the `steps` template.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: WorkflowTemplate
metadata:
  name: multiple-steps-dag
spec:
  entrypoint: all-steps
  arguments:
    parameters:
    # Should these variables overwrite the parameter in the task?
    - name: what-to-say
    - name: max-number
  templates:
  
  - name: all-steps
    dag:
      tasks:
      - name: the-very-first-step
        template: run-python
        arguments:
          parameters:
            # Here we provide the vue for the input parameter max-number as 50
            - name: max-number
              value: "50"
      - name: my-second-step
        template: whalesay
        dependencies: ["the-very-first-step"]
        arguments:
          parameters:
            # Here we provide the vue for the input parameter what-to-say
            - name: what-to-say
              value: "Hello from the first task"


  - name: run-python
    inputs:
      parameters:
        - name: max-number
          value: "100"
    script:
      image: python:3
      command: [python]
      source: |
        import random
        # Generate a random integer between 1 and 100
        i = random.randint(1, {{inputs.parameters.max-number}})
        print(i)
  
  - name: whalesay
    inputs:
      parameters:
        - name: what-to-say
          value: "Hello from the parameters"
    container:
      image: docker/whalesay
      command: [cowsay]
      args: ["{{inputs.parameters.what-to-say}}"]
```

Then, what happened here?

- The tasks are being used from a template invocator
- The entrypoint, being the template invocator, is the one that should get and provide the parameters from the main workflow. It should be the bridge for the parameters, from the `spec.parameters`.

In this case, if we want to get the variables from the `spec.parameters` then we will need to make use of local variables inside the entrypoint task as follows:


```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: WorkflowTemplate
metadata:
  name: multiple-steps-dag
spec:
  entrypoint: all-steps
  arguments:
    parameters:
    # This will overwrite the parameter in the task!
    - name: what-to-say
    - name: max-number
  templates:
  
  - name: all-steps
    inputs:
      parameters:
      # This will overwrite the parameter in the task!
      - name: what-to-say
      - name: max-number
    dag:
      tasks:
      - name: the-very-first-step
        template: run-python
        arguments:
          parameters:
            - name: max-number
              value: "{{inputs.parameters.max-number}}"
      - name: my-second-step
        template: whalesay
        # Here we specify that this task depends on the first one
        dependencies: ["the-very-first-step"]
        arguments:
          parameters:
            - name: what-to-say
              value: "{{inputs.parameters.what-to-say}}"


  - name: run-python
    inputs:
      parameters:
        - name: max-number
          value: "100"
    script:
      image: python:3
      command: [python]
      source: |
        import random
        # Generate a random integer between 1 and 100
        i = random.randint(1, {{inputs.parameters.max-number}})
        print(i)
  
  - name: whalesay
    inputs:
      parameters:
        - name: what-to-say
          value: "Hello from the parameters"
    container:
      image: docker/whalesay
      command: [cowsay]
      args: ["{{inputs.parameters.what-to-say}}"]
```


**Exercise:**

Create a WorkflowTemplate called `clone-repo` that runs one task/template that clones a git repository.
The task will receive the URL of the repo as input parameter.
If the variable is not passed, it should clone the following repo https://github.com/devopscompanynl/argowf-course.git
