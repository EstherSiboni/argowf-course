## Outputs and conditionals

### Outputs

The output information produced by templates or tasks is not always a set of files, sometimes the information produced by the template or task is just a simple string or short text.

If that is the case, then there is no need to share a volume between pods to pass output information, we can make use of `outputs`.

In the following example, the `run-tests` template will generate an output variable. The value of it will be represented by content of a file called `/tmp/results.txt`.

Let's create the following Workflow to show its usage.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: output-parameter-
spec:
  entrypoint: output-parameter
  templates:
  - name: output-parameter
    steps:
    - - name: test-phase
        template: run-tests
    - - name: consume-parameter
        template: print-message
        arguments:
          parameters:
          - name: message
            # As argument of this task we can use the output variable
            # from the previous task
            value: "{{steps.test-phase.outputs.parameters.result-tests}}"

  - name: run-tests
    container:
      image: ubuntu
      command:
      - /bin/bash
      - -c
      - |
        echo "Running tests..."
        sleep 2
        echo "And more tests..."
        sleep 2
        echo "The tests went good!"

        # Here we are assigning the value of the variable
        echo -n "success" > /tmp/result.txt
    # Here we declare the possible output parameters
    outputs:
      parameters:
      # The name of the output parameter is result-tests
      - name: result-tests
        valueFrom:
          path: /tmp/result.txt

  - name: print-message
    inputs:
      parameters:
      - name: message
    container:
      image: docker/whalesay:latest
      command: [cowsay]
      args: ["The result of the test were {{inputs.parameters.message}}!!!"]
```

You can test again the previous example by changing the line `echo -n "success" > /tmp/result.txt` by `echo -n "error" > /tmp/result.txt`

You can see that the message of the `print-message` task changes accordingly.

### Conditionals

In the previous example, we used a template to print a happy whale even if the value of the output parameter was not `success`.

In a bit more realistic scenario we might change the way we show this result, or maybe we want to perform a totally different action when the result is not successful, like sending a notification or fire an alert; and that perhaps needs to be done by using another different container image.

For those kinds of scenarios, Argo Worflows offers conditinals. In the template invocators we can add the `when` attribute that can evaluate if the task can be skept or run, depending on the result of a condition.

In the previous example, we could retrieve the output parameter with the expression `steps.test-phase.outputs.parameters.result-tests`. In the `when` parameter that expression can be used in a condition like this, to skip a task:

```yaml
when: "{{steps.test-phase.outputs.parameters.result-tests}} == success"
```

In the following example, we will run the same task called `test-phase`, it will produce the same output parameter, but this time we will have two additional tasks called success and error, they will make of two different templates that use different container images and they will run or not based on the result of the output parameter from the first task.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: output-parameter-
spec:
  entrypoint: output-parameter
  templates:
  - name: output-parameter
    steps:

    # This step will produce an output parameter
    - - name: test-phase
        template: run-tests

    # If the the output parameter result-tests is success then this task will run
    - - name: success
        template: print-message-success
        when: "{{steps.test-phase.outputs.parameters.result-tests}} == success"
    # If the the output parameter result-tests is different than success then this task will not run
    - - name: error
        template: print-message-error
        when: "{{steps.test-phase.outputs.parameters.result-tests}} != success"

  - name: run-tests
    container:
      image: ubuntu
      command:
      - /bin/bash
      - -c
      - |
        echo "Running tests..."
        sleep 2
        echo "And more tests..."
        sleep 2
        echo "The tests went good!"
        echo -n "success" > /tmp/result.txt
    outputs:
      parameters:
      - name: result-tests
        valueFrom:
          path: /tmp/result.txt

  - name: print-message-success
    container:
      image: docker/whalesay:latest
      command: [cowsay]
      args: ["The result of the test were a success!!!"]
  
  - name: print-message-error
    container:
      image: ubuntu:latest
      command: [bash]
      script: |
        echo "Unfortunatelly the result of the tests was a failure..."
        echo "Making a very bad report"
```

**Exercise:**

Create a fork of the repository https://github.com/devopscompanynl/argowf-course

Generate a new personal access token here https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

Click on the checkbox **repo** when you select the permissions.

Enhance the WorkflowTemplate you created in the [previous lesson](./4.share-volumes.md) with the following characteristics:

- Replace the URL of the repository with your fork
- [Create an access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- Add an output parameter to the test step with the result of the test. You can use the following script to determine if the test went good or bad:

```bash
python -m unittest discover

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "success" > /tmp/result.txt
else
    echo "failure" > /tmp/result.txt
fi
```

- Add an additional task to send a curl request. You can use the following script to do it

```bash
cd /mount/argowf-course
commit_sha=`git rev-parse HEAD`
owner_repo=devopscompanynl #replace this value with your username
result_test=`cat /tmp/result.txt`
github_token=xxxxxxxxx

# http request that updates the status of the commit
# Taken from https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/statuses?apiVersion=2022-11-28
curl -L \
  -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $github_token" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$owner_repo/argowf-course/statuses/$commit_sha \
  -d "{\"state\":\"$result_test\",\"target_url\":\"http://mynode:32746\",\"description\":\"The build status is $result_test\",\"context\":\"continuous-integration/argowf\"}"
```
