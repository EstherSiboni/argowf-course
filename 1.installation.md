## Installation of Argo WorkFlows


There are mainly two ways to install Argo WorkFlows:

- By applying standard templates
- By installing the Helm Chart

In this course we will learn how to install it via the Helm Chart

First, we need to create the custom values with the desired configuration

```bash
# Create the directory ~/workflows/installation and access it

mkdir -p ~/workflows/installation
cd $_

# Create the custom-values.yaml file

cat <<EOF > custom-values.yaml
workflow:
  # we will configure the chart to create a new Service Account
  # The SA will only have access to two namespaces
  serviceAccount:
    create: true
    name: "argo-workflow"
  rbac:
    create: true
controller:
  workflowNamespaces:
  # The SA will only have access to the default and argowf namespaces
    - default
    - argowf
server:
  # We will access to the workflow via NodePort
  serviceType: NodePort

  # We will access to the dashboard using the port 32746
  serviceNodePort: 32746
EOF
```

The values file is ready. Now it is time to add the argo repo and install the argo workflows chart.

```bash
# Add the argo repo
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm

# Install the argo workflows chart
helm install my-argowf argo/argo-workflows \
  -n argowf \
  --create-namespace \
  -f custom-values.yaml
```

We can take a look at the pods to check if they are up and running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n argowf -w
```

Once all pods are in a running state, we can access to the dashboard by visiting the following address http://mynode:32746

Great! But we are not ready to access yet. We still need to create a token to be able to access to the dashboard.

Argo Workflows uses the RBAC mechanism from k8s to authenticate and authorize requests.

To generate a token, first we need to create a Service Account. With the Service Account we can control the scope of the token. 

In k8s we can generate roles or we also can make use of the preconfigured roles that already come by default.

For now, we will make use of the admin role, which has enough permissions to access and manipulate the resources that come with Argo WorkFlows

```bash
# Create the Service Account argowf-admin
kubectl create sa argowf-admin -n argowf

# Create a Service Role Binding to assign the admin role to the SA argowf-admin
kubectl create clusterrolebinding argowf-rb \
  --clusterrole=admin \
  --serviceaccount=argowf:argowf-admin \
  -n argowf
```

We can generate a new token by creating a new k8s secret. The annotation `kubernetes.io/service-account.name: argowf-admin` will be noticed by k8s, then it will fill in the secret with the credentials to interact with the k8s API.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: argowf-admin.service-account-token
  namespace: argowf
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: argowf-admin
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
EOF
```

The token is generated immediately, we just need to retrieve it with the following command:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n argowf \
  argowf-admin.service-account-token \
  -o json | jq -r .data.token | base64 -d
```

Please copy paste the token in your notes because we might need it later.

Open again the dashboard http://localhost:32746/login and locate the column in the middle that says *If your organisation has configured client authentication, get your token following this instructions from here and paste in this box:*, then fill in the form the following text:

```
Bearer TOKEN
```

Then click on *LOGIN*.

Welcome to Argo WorkFlows!
