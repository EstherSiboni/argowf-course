## Working with Workflows

### Template definitions

In ArgoWF there are multiple types of templates to define tasks.

For the following examples, access to the VM and create these files in a directory and the apply them with the command:

```bash
kubectl create -f example.yaml
```

As soon as you create the Workflow resources you can take a look at them in the dashboard.

In the dashboard, the very first button on the left sidebar shows you the running workflows.

We will start testing the container template.

**Container**

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: hello-world-
spec:
  entrypoint: whalesay
  templates:
  - name: whalesay
    container:
      image: docker/whalesay
      command: [cowsay]
      args: ["hello world"]
```

Once you create one workflow you can take a look in that view the status of your running workflow.

If you click on it, you will find more detailed information about the Workflow, like:

- Exit status
- Produced logs
- Metadata like: creation time, duration, etc

Now let's test a more practical example. In multiple pipelines, one of the required steps is cloning a repository.

We can make use of the `alpine/git` image to clone a public repository.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: clone-repo-
spec:
  entrypoint: clone
  templates:
  - name: clone
    container:
      image: alpine/git
      command:
      - /bin/sh
      - -c
      - |
        git clone https://github.com/devopscompanynl/argowf-course.git
```

You can also run any kinds of scripts. Since you will make use of containers, any possible programming language can be used.

In this example we will run a small python script to demonstrate how to run it.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: run-python-
spec:
  entrypoint: run-python
  templates:
  - name: run-python
    container:
      image: python:3
      command:
      - /bin/bash
      - -c
      - |
        python - <<END
        import random
        # Generate a random integer between 1 and 100
        i = random.randint(1, 100)
        print(i)
        END
```

**Script**

To be honest, the previous example was a bit cumbersome to read.

For that reason, the script template is handy when the template needs to execute a script.

As you can see, the template looks cleaner.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: run-python-
spec:
  entrypoint: run-python
  templates:
  - name: run-python
    script:
      image: python:3
      command: [python]
      source: |
        import random
        # Generate a random integer between 1 and 100
        i = random.randint(1, 100)
        print(i)

```


What happens if we append two templates in a sinle Workflow... Is it going to run two tasks? Let's test!

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: run-python-multiple-
spec:
  entrypoint: random-num
  templates:
  - name: random-num
    script:
      image: python:3
      command: [python]
      source: |
        import random
        # Generate a random integer between 1 and 100
        i = random.randint(1, 100)
        print(i)
  # This template won't be able to be executed :(
  # We will check later how to solve this
  - name: some-obj
    script:
      image: python:3
      command: [python]
      source: |
        i = {
          'key': 'value',
        }
        print(i)
```

In this case, it only executed the template indicated in the entrypoint... Well, we will show how to execute multiple tasks in a Workflow a bit later

*Suspend*

This is a special type of task. This is useful when the pipeline needs a manual approval.
For now we only want to see how it looks. Later we will check how it works in more detail.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: approve-me-
spec:
  entrypoint: approve-me
  templates:
  - name: approve-me
    suspend: {}

```


### Template Invocators

I promissed I would show you how to create Workflows with multiple steps. We can do it by using template invocators.

**Steps**

With this type of template we can run multiple steps sequentially/

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: steps-
spec:
  entrypoint: all-steps
  templates:
  # This is the invocator
  - name: all-steps
    steps:
    - - name: the-very-first-step
        template: whalesay
    - - name: my-second-step
        template: run-python
  
  # The previous task will invoke these two
  - name: whalesay
    container:
      image: docker/whalesay
      command: [cowsay]
      args: ["hello world"]
  - name: run-python
    script:
      image: python:3
      command: [python]
      source: |
        import random
        # Generate a random integer between 1 and 100
        i = random.randint(1, 100)
        print(i)
```

**Dag**

We can also define multiple steps using the dag template. A dag template allows you to define your tasks as a graph of dependencies.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: dag-
spec:
  entrypoint: all-steps
  templates:
  
  # This is the entrypoint
  - name: all-steps
    dag:
      tasks:
      - name: the-very-first-step
        template: run-python
      - name: my-second-step
        template: whalesay

  # These are all the templates

  # This is the python task
  - name: run-python
    script:
      image: python:3
      command: [python]
      source: |
        import random
        # Generate a random integer between 1 and 100
        i = random.randint(1, 100)
        print(i)
  
  # This is the whalesay task
  - name: whalesay
    container:
      image: docker/whalesay
      command: [cowsay]
      args: ["hello world"]
```

Nice, I can simultaneous tasks/templates. But how can I define when a task depends of other? Then we need to introduce the `dependencies` parameter.


```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: dag-
spec:
  entrypoint: all-steps
  templates:
  
  - name: all-steps
    dag:
      tasks:
      - name: the-very-first-step
        template: run-python
      - name: my-second-step
        template: whalesay
        # Here we specify that this task depends on the first one
        dependencies: ["the-very-first-step"]


  - name: run-python
    script:
      image: python:3
      command: [python]
      source: |
        import random
        # Generate a random integer between 1 and 100
        i = random.randint(1, 100)
        print(i)
  
  - name: whalesay
    container:
      image: docker/whalesay
      command: [cowsay]
      args: ["hello world"]
```


**Exercises:**

1. Create a new Workflow with the following steps by using the `steps` invocator:

   1.  Ask for approval. Use the `suspend` definition for this task.
   2.  Python Hello World. Use the `script` definition for this task to run this python script:

```python
name_school = "NHLS"
print(f"Hello from {name_school}")
```

2. Create another workflow with the same steps by using the `dag` invocator. Keep in mind that they need to follow the same sequence


If you finish it then it means it's time for an obligated coffee! â˜•
