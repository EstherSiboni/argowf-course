## Retrying failed templates

In certain situations, to inject resilency in our pipelines we need to redo or retry tasks when they fail, specially when there are known networks hiccus or an external system is not that reliable.

In every task we can make us of `retryStrategy` parameter to set the number of times the task should be retried, also you can set certain [policies](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/retries/#retry-policies) to evaluate if the task should be retried or not.

```yaml

  entrypoint: main
  templates:
    - name: main

            template: http
            arguments:
              parameters:
                - name: url
                  # This is my node, sometimes is on, sometimes is off
                  value: "http://52.166.94.56:5050/some-file.json"
  
    - name: http
      retryStrategy:
        # We will rerun this task 10 times
        limit: "10"
