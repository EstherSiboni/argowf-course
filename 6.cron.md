## Working with Cron workflows

It is a common pattern the usage of crons to run processes in specific times of the day.

Argo Workflows offers a Cron resource for these kinds of scenarios when a pipeline needs to be triggered by a scheduled time. The time is configured using the Unix Cron schedule syntax. If you are not familiarized with Unix/Linux cron schedule schedules you can check some examples here https://crontab.guru/

In the following example, we choose to run a workflow every minute. The workflow will execute a powershell script.

Check the possible options for the Cron [here](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/cron-workflows/#cronworkflow-options).

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: CronWorkflow
metadata:
  name: cron-every-minute
spec:
  schedule: "* * * * *"
  workflowSpec:
    entrypoint: pwsh
    templates:
    - name: pwsh
      container:
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/powershell
        command:
        - pwsh
        - -c
        - |
          Write-Output 'Now we are running a powershell script every minute!'
```

**Exercise:**

Create a new Cron that checks if a table exists in a sql server, otherwise create it.
The Cron needs to be executed every 5 minutes.
